1. UI Design Story
  - One tool is very old, not support new technology, keep it running spent a lot of money from buisness.
  - Build a UI for replacing the old tool, migrate the data
  - Gather requirements, build the UI, review with users, improve the look feel and functions. 
    - You don't have to meet all the requirements. 
    - When you replace the old tool, make sure understand how user use it before.
    - Don't try to make a perfect delivery first time, provide something small simple, and extend on that.
  
2. Data migration for CORE
  - An old database, has a lot of network data. 30+ teams run queries pull data everyday. super slow, leadership want to provide better way for downstream consumers.
  - migrate data, let our team become the source of the truth. 
  - Build ETL jobs to run query against DB, and prepare the s3 files for other system.
    - Need very careful monitor the job.
    - add email notification, split team member to on call, have standard operation procedure when job fail
    - add data validation, size, type and etc. 
    
3. Customer support after CORE live.
  - Data issue, user not familiar with new tool
 
 
4. AP stacking issue.

5. CRD Tool that no one use. 
   - Engineer spend long time to prepare a config and a lot of manual work
   - Build tools to easy this process.
   - Work with data expert, build UI/API 
    - A tool user use everyday. 
    - Spend weeks build the tool, but no one use it.
    - Get support from leadership, work with engineers, add more functions they need essentially.
